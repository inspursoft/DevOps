#### To set up ssh access via public keys ###################

You can use this to deploy your public key to all the nodes.  Just put the root
pword for all nodes in ~/rootpassword and make sure you have sshpass installed.
See the comments in keys.yml to explain the failing ping and offer some other
options.

$ ansible-playbook -i inventory ping.yml # This will look like it fails, that's ok
$ ansible-playbook -i inventory keys.yml

#### To set up a hackish static networking for the pods #####

Decide what /24 network each one of your minions should use to expose pods.  You
need a /24 for EACH minion.
The network ranges you picked above go in their respective kube_ip_addr= vars.

$ ansible-playbook -i inventory hack-network.yml
