# Using this module REQUIRES the sshpass package to be installed!
#
# This REQUIRES you have created a ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub public key
#
# Place the root password for all nodes in ~/rootpassword, run this playbook,
# and it will put your public key on all the nodes.  Then delete rootpassword!
#
# You can also comment out the "vars" section and use --ask-pass on the command
# line.
#
# All ansible modules will fail if the host is not in the ssh known_hosts.
# Normally ansible just asks if the host key is acceptable.  BUT when using
# password instead of public key authentication it will not ask and will instead
# fail.
#
# You can solve this by running a meaningless play to first get the ssh host
# key, then lay down the public key. Something like:
#       ansible-playbook -i inventory ping.yml
# Then answer yes as you check the host keys.
#
# You also could set the environment variable ANSIBLE_HOST_KEY_CHECKING=False
# when running this playbook.  You would have to answer the host key questions
# the next time you run ansible.
